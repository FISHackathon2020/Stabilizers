# Stabilizers
The Stabilizer's FIS Virtual Hackathon 2020 Solution

## Problem Statement
The nature of student engagement has changed. As a company that values the talent and ideas that college students bring, we want to ensure that we're engaging with students on their terms. The goal of this challenge is to create a tool that will allow us to collect valuable information about a student's experiences and interests in order to partner through internships, co-ops, and other opportunities. 

## Solution
### EduConnect
EduConnect is a platform which bridges the gap between students and recruiters. Today, the most popular platform for acquiring a job is LinkedIn. LinkedIn has the concept of connections implemented, but not the practice. This is where EduConnect comes in. EduConnect allows students and hobbyists looking for internships, co-op, or part and full time jobs to find and interact with recruiters from across the globe. To do this we collect basic information about the student

#### Core Features
 - Video calls for chats, interviews, and general discussion
 - Resume Parser
 - Tag system for connecting students with opportunities.
 - Import, Export, or **Merge** a LinkedIn account
 
### What were we able to implement?
 - Scalable User account system
 - Interactive Feed
 - Portfolio/Profile Page

### What features would we like to implement in the future?
 - A stand-out feature that separates us further from LinkedIn. Maybe a TikTok like video feed of recruiters talking about their company's opportunities?
